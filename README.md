   <b>Welcome to Statistics 101L: Data Analysis and Statistical Inference!</b>
   <br><br>
   <b> Course Description</b>
    <br> 
Introduction to statistics as a science of understanding and analyzing data. Themes include data collection, exploratory analysis, inference, and modeling. Focus on       principles underlying quantitative research in social sciences, humanities, and public policy. Research projects teach the process of scientific discovery and synthesis and critical evaluation of research and statistical arguments. Readings give perspective on why in 1950, S. Wilks said, "Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary a        qualification  for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write." 
  <br><br>
  <i>As a quantitative social scientist, I am particularly excited to show you how I use data to answer questions on a variety of topics in political science and public policy. We will also discuss how social scientists and humanists in other fields use data in their research.</i>
   <br><br>
   <b> Coming Due This Week</b> <br>
The first lab will be due on Friday August 21st.
<br><br>
   <b> Class Meetings </b><br>
   This course will use a flipped classroom format. Before each class session, there will be some readings and video lectures (see “Required Texts” below) to read and watch that focus on core statistical concepts or applications to social science/humanities research. Live Zoom sessions each day at 12:30 PM will focus on working through problems together and in groups in breakout rooms, answering questions, and discussing practical applications of the statistical concepts for that day. I will not take attendance at    Zoom sessions and I will provide a recording if you cannot attend. You should also enroll in a lab session. These sessions, led by two TAs (one graduate student and one undergraduate student), will provide guidance on how to use the statistical software R. As with the main session, I encourage you to attend if possible,   but I will make a recording available if you cannot attend. This will be a fast-paced course condensed into a short time-frame, so it is important to keep up with course material. However, I understand that challenges may arise during the semester, so I urge you to reach out to me if you have any concerns.

   <a href="https://jacobfhsmith.github.io/mypage/">Jacob:</a> I an Assistant Research Professor in the Stats Department as of July 1st. Previously I was a Lecturing Fellow in the Thompson Writing Program here at Duke and before that completed a Ph.D. in Political Science at UNC-Chapel Hill. I enjoy using data and statistics to answer research questions on topics ranging from the electoral effect of <a href="https://libkey.io/libraries/229/articles/56283884/full-text-file?utm_source=api_871"> Cherie Berry's elevator pictures</a> to what it's like to be in the minority party in Congress. I really enjoy mentoring undergraduate student research projects that use data to answer research questions.
